# ls_color_configscript
This is a super simple but a bit bloated ls color configurator.
Be warned this does overwrite your current .bashrc so there are no conflicts in it.
Please back up your PS1 if you have a custom one or any other alasies you care about.
Other wise, please report any bugs or errors to me @ iloveabby@mailfence.com
Thank.
